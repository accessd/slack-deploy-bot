## Production

### How to setup

1. Clone the repo
2. `cp ./config/config.sample.rb ./config/config.rb`
3. Edit `./config/config.rb` to add configuration for your app
4. `bundle install --without development test`
5. You can try to launch bot with `SLACK_API_TOKEN=xxx bundle exec ruby run.rb` and test it
6. Launch bot as a daemon (you can use *eye, upstart, systemd*, etc.)

I'd recommend to use **eye** gem for launching bot. But it's up to you.

### Launching with eye

Please follow instruction on [[https://github.com/kostya/eye]] for installing **eye**

Put in the root *.slack-api-token* file which contains api token

Create **config/slack-deploy-bot.eye** config using **config/slack-deploy-bot.eye.sample** as sample

For first time or if slack-deploy-bot.eye config was changed than run:

    eye load config/slack-deploy-bot.eye

Start bot:

    eye start slack-deploy-bot

Restart bot with command:

    eye r slack-deploy-bot

Info about bot process:

    eye i slack-deploy-bot

## Configuration

Copy *config/config.sample.rb* to *config/config.rb*

Example of `config.rb`:

```ruby
DeployBot.setup do |config|
  config.apps = {
    :'my-awesome-app' => {
      envs: [:staging, :prod],
      path: '~/projects/my-awesome-app',
      default_branch: :master, # default branch to deploy
      deploy_cmd: ->(env, branch) { "./deploy.sh #{env} #{branch}" } # deploy with Ansible for example
    },
    :'my-second-awesome-app': {
      envs: [:dev, :prod],
      path: '~/projects/my-second-awesome-app',
      deploy_cmd: ->(env, branch) { "BRANCH_NAME=#{branch} bundle exec cap #{env} deploy" } # deploy with Capistrano
    }
  }
end
```

Required options for each app: *envs*, *path*, *deploy_cmd*

## Development & Testing

Start bot with command:

    SLACK_API_TOKEN=xxx foreman start

Start console with:

    bundle exec ./console

Run specs with:

    bundle exec rake

Before starting specs please run:

    git submodule update --init

for fetching *spec/support/dummy_app*

## TODO

1. ~~Configuration (apps, envs, default branch, deploy command)~~
2. ~~Notifications to channel about starting/ending/failing deploy events~~
3. ~~Specs~~
